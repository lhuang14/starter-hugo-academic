* Showed that media sounds, such as the melodies of notification tones (e.g., iPhone message and Samsung whistle) can be directly used to sense and verify the userâ€™s gripping hand.
* Developed a cross-domain method to validate hard-to-forge physical relationships among the mic, speaker, and accelerometer to prevent external sounds from cheating the system.
