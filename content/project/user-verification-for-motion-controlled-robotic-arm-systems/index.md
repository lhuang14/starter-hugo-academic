* Built up a motion-controlled robotic arm framework comprising a robotic arm end and a user end, which are connected via a network and responsible for manipulator control and motion capture respectively.
* Proposed to verify who is controlling the robotic arm by examining the robotic armâ€™s behavior, which adds a second security layer in addition to the system login credentials.
