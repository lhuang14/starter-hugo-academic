* Proposed a novel acoustically extracted hand-grip biometric, which is associated with every userâ€™s hand geometry, body-fat ratio, and gripping strength; It is implicit and available whenever the user grips a handheld device.
* Integrated a coding technique in the biometric acquisition process, which encodes static biometrics into dynamic biometric features to prevent data reuse. This low-cost method can be deployed on any handheld device that has a speaker and a microphone.
