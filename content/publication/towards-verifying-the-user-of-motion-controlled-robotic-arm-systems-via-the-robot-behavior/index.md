abstract: Motion-controlled robotic arms allow a user to interact with a remote
  real world without physically reaching it. By connecting cyberspace to the
  physical world, such interactive teleoperations are promising to improve
  remote education, virtual social interactions and online participatory
  activities. In this work, we build up a motion-controlled robotic arm
  framework comprising a robotic arm end and a user end, which are connected via
  a network and responsible for manipulator control and motion capture
  respectively. To protect the system access, we propose to verify who is
  controlling the robotic arm by examining the robotic arm’s behavior, which
  adds a second security layer in addition to the system login credentials. We
  show that a robotic arm’s motion inherits its human controller’s behavioral
  biometric in interactive control scenarios. By extracting the angle readings
  of the robotic arm’s all joints, the proposed user authentication approach
  reconstructs the robotic arm’s end-effector movement trajectory that follows
  the user’s hand. Furthermore, we derive the unique robotic motion features to
  capture the user’s be- havioral biometric embedded in the robot motions and
  develop learning-based algorithms to verify the robotic arm user to be one of
  the enrolled users or a nonuser. Extensive experiments show that our system
  achieves 94% accuracy to distinguish users while preventing user identity
  spoofing attacks with 95% accuracy.
