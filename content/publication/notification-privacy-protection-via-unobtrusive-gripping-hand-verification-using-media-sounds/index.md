abstract: This work proposes a media sound-based authentication method to
  protect smartphone notification privacy unobtrusively, which wisely hides or
  presents sensitive content by verifying who is hold- ing the phone. We show
  that media sounds, such as the melodies of notification tones (e.g., iPhone
  message and Samsung whistle) can be directly used to sense and verify the
  user’s gripping hand. Because sounds and vibrations co-exist, we capture two
  novel re- sponses via the smartphone mic and accelerometer to describe how the
  individual’s contacting palm interferes with the signals in two different
  domains. Based on the two responses, we develop a convolutional neural
  network-based algorithm to verify the user. Moreover, because the smartphone
  sensors are all embedded on the same motherboard, we develop a cross-domain
  method to validate such hard-to-forge physical relationships among the mic,
  speaker and accelerometer. They prevent external sounds from cheating the
  system. Additionally, we consider the notification vibration as a special type
  of media sound, which also results in two responses, and extend our method to
  work in the silent mode. Extensive exper- iments with ten notification tones
  and four phone models show that our system verifies users with 95% accuracy
  and prevents replay sounds with 100% accuracy.
